# explorerspammer
Use this incase you 'forgot' how to get to the Windows Explorer on a friends computer
[Latest release here](https://github.com/mastrpcs/explorerspam/releases/latest)


## Usage:
launch the python file, if python files are 'accidentally' blocked, zip the file by itself and run through the zip 
(it works the same as running normally, just bypasses any 'normal' or 'forgotten about' checks)

## Have fun!
*Any issues feel free to open an issue and have a go at fixing it*
